# Data Science (DS) and Machine Learning (ML) Projects



In this repository, I'm uploading mostly i.e., code (python, and matlab scripts), and notebooks (jupyter notebook) for demonstrating several basic projects. I have completed these projects to get a clear idea about the DS-ML projects of different aspects.

ðŸš€ I recently started a new challange to make myself better. Every week I will try to do some smaller projects, and will upload those into this repository in order to share my knowledge to the DS-ML community. 

**REQUEST: I'm looking for the guidance motivated Data Scientists to help me build high environmental impact algorithms. You can email me (junhasan@gmail.com)**
